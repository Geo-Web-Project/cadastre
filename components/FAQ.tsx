                    The Geo Web is a system of digital land property rights that
                    creates consensus for anchoring digital content to physical
                    land. All funds generated by the protocol's land market are
                    used to fund the public good.

                    . It’s a blend of private and communal ownership. Geo Web
                    land parcels are licensed rather than sold outright to
                    market participants.

                    Each land claim requires a flat 0.005 ETHx registration
                    payment. Licensors then pay an annual network fee (currently
                    10%) based on their self-determined `For Sale Price` of the
                    parcel. To help make sure parcels aren’t underpriced and
                    “squatted” on, any other market participant can place a bid
                    at or above the current price of the parcel. A bid must be
                    accepted (the licensor is paid their `For Sale Price` and
                    the asset is transferred) or rejected (the licensor pays a
                    penalty equal to 10% of incoming bid value) within 7 days.

                    The community multi-sig will have the ability to modify the
                    core infrastructure out of necessity. As the technology and
                    the network mature, we will progressively decentralize this
                    decision-making authority and implement democratic
                    governance systems.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The network itself generates funds through its partial
                    common ownership system, but no one person, team, or entity
                    exercises direct control of that cash flow. These funds will
                    be used to fund public goods and generate positive-sum
                    outcomes. We hope lots of people make money (by creating
                    value) on the Geo Web.
