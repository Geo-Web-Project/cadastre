# Geo Web Cadastre

## Getting Started

Create an account on [mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/).
Once you have an account, create a token on mapbox.
Create a .env file in the Cadastre folder with this line of code and your new token from mapbox:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_REACT_APP_MAPBOX_TOKEN={{your_mapbox_token}}
```

Install Node Version 16 if you don't have it.
If you have a Mac, you can use this command
```
brew install node@16
```
Otherwise download from [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

For the first time setup, run yarn to download all your dependencies
```
yarn
```

To run locally
```
yarn dev
```
