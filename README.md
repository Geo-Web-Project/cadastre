### Getting Started

Start by setting up the local environment variables.

#### Mapbox
Create an account on [mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/).
Once you have an account, create a token on mapbox.
Update the .env file in the Cadastre folder with this line of code and your new token from mapbox:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_REACT_APP_MAPBOX_TOKEN=your_mapbox_token
```
#### Infura
If you don't already have an account, create one at [Infura](https://www.infura.io/).
Once you have an account, create a project for GeoWeb and copy the API key.
Update the .env file in the Cadastre folder with this line of code:
(Note: you may need to activate the addon for Optimism):
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_INFURA_PROJECT_ID=your_infura_project_id
```
#### Web3 Storage
If you don't already have an account, create one at [Web3 Storage](https://web3.storage/).
Once you have an account, create a new API Token and copy it.
Update the .env file in the Cadastre folder with this line of code:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_WEB3_STORAGE_TOKEN=your_web3storage_api_token
```

### Testing

During development cycles you will need Optimism Goerli ETH. There are two ways to obtain OP Goerli ETH.
1. Faucet
    Head over to the [Paradigm Faucet](https://faucet.paradigm.xyz/) and enter the address of the wallet you would like to fund.

2. Bridge
    If you already have Goerli ETH you can use the [Optimism Bridge](https://app.optimism.io/bridge/deposit). Connect you wallet, select the Goerli Test net and the amount you would like to bridge.
